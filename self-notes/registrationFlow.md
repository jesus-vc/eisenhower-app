Flow:

- BACKEND

  - User register.

    - should call another User method that generates the token
    - .generateToken

  - Question:

    - If there are multiple simultaneous requests, how would the route handle distinct requests if they are all calling the same method?
    - And since this would be a live server, is there a need to kill off these requests?
    - Should this be a static method?
    -

  - /verify route handles verification link requests.
  - validate that the token in the link was generated by the server by querying a DB table.
  - if link valid:
    - moves user to from 'unregistered' to 'registered' table.
    - delete the token
  - link signs in the user (returns a token)
  - routed to user's homepage

- CLIENT
- if valid:
- if invalid:
  - routed to error page
  - user clicks on a button to send a new OTP.

Questions:

1. Create 2 tables ('registered' and 'unregistered')?
